# MongoDB Trigger

The MongoDB Trigger parses the incoming webhook payload from the MongoDB webhook triggers. In other words, **the
BuildShip Workflow runs every time there are any changes in the linked MongoDB Collection, Database, or Deployment**.
Alternatively, the workflow can also be made to run based on a given schedule (or a CRON expression); however, this
documentation is for setting up a Database Trigger.

## Prerequisites âœ…

- A MongoDB Project. If you don't have one set up, click [here](https://www.mongodb.com) to set one up.

## Adding MongoDB Trigger

<Video src='/assets/mongo-trigg-setup.mov' />

- Create a new BuildShip Workflow and click on the "**Add Trigger**" button. Select (or search for) the **MongoDB
  Trigger** and add it to the workflow.

- Open the Instruction panel ðŸ“Ž and copy the **Webhook URL**.

- To test the MongoDB Trigger functionality, click on the "**Add Node**" button and search for the
  `Log message to console` node and add it to the workflow. For the input values, pass in the Request Body from the
  context menu.

- Hit "**Ship!** ðŸš€". Read the following section to complete the testing setup.

- Navigate to your MongoDB Dashboard and navigate to the "**Triggers**" section.

- Pick your desired type of trigger from **Database** - which will listen to changes to your database, or
  **Scheduled** - which will trigger the event at the chosen schedule. For this example, we will be setting up a
  **Database Trigger**.

- Follow the instructions and set up your source details.

- Under the Function section, select "**Function**" as the Event Type.

- Inside the Function script editor, paste the following script. Copy the **Webhook URL** from the **MongoDB Trigger in
  your BuildShip** workflow, and paste it on `line 5`:

```javascript {5} showLineNumbers
import axios from 'axios';
import crypto from 'crypto';

exports = async function (changeEvent) {
  const webhookUrl = ''; // Add your webhook URL here
  const workflowId = webhookUrl.split('/').pop();

  try {
    const signature = generateSignature(changeEvent, workflowId);

    const res = await axios.post(webhookUrl, changeEvent, {
      headers: {
        'X-Webhook-Signature': signature,
      },
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(changeEvent));
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending webhook:', error);
    return false;
  }
};

function generateSignature(data, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  hmac.update(JSON.stringify(data));
  return hmac.digest('hex');
}
```

- Click on the "**Add Dependency**" button and add `axios`, then hit "**Add**". This will install the dependency for the
  function execution. Similarly, add a dependency for the `crypto` package.

- Once this is done, click on the "**â–¶ï¸Ž Run**" button at the bottom. If set up correctly, this should return `true` as
  the output on the console.

<Callout>
  The code snippet uses the `axios` library to send the POST request to the webhook URL, and the `crypto` library to
  generate a signature for the webhook payload. The signature is included in the request headers to **ensure the
  authenticity of the request**.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up the MongoDB Trigger, here are some common troubleshooting tips:

- **Double-check the Webhook URL:** Ensure that you've copied the correct Webhook URL from BuildShip and pasted it into
  the MongoDB Function script.

- **Verify dependencies:** Make sure you've added the required `axios` and `crypto` dependencies to the MongoDB
  Function.

- **Review the logs:** Check the MongoDB Function logs for any error messages or helpful information that can assist in
  troubleshooting.
