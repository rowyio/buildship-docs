Rowy Triggers in BuildShip allow you to initiate a BuildShip workflow in response to specific events within your Rowy
Project. This integration enables you to automate tasks seamlessly based on events that occur in your Rowy environment.

<Callout emoji='ðŸš€' type='tip'>
  This method also acts as a **Firebase Trigger**, allowing you to efficiently manage your Firebase Data with both Rowy
  and BuildShip.

## Pre-requisites âœ…

For this integration to work, you will need:

- A Rowy Project with a Rowy Run set up. If you don't have a Rowy Project, you can create one [here](https://rowy.app/).

## Configuration in BuildShip

<Steps>
### Add a Rowy Trigger
After creating a new workflow in BuildShip, click on **Add a Trigger** and select **Rowy Trigger** from the available options.

### Add in your Rowy Project ID

In the Project ID field add your Rowy Project ID. Click on the link icon on the top right within the trigger to copy the
configuration details required for the next steps.

<Image src={rowy3} alt='Rowy Project ID' width={1200} />

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘€">
To get your Rowy Project ID, go to your Rowy Table and click on your profile picture on the top right. You'll find the Project ID under the your Email Id.

</Callout>

</Steps>

This is all you need to do in BuildShip to set up the Rowy Trigger. Now, let's set up the BuildShip Extension our Rowy
Table.

## Setting up the Rowy Extension

<Steps>
### Add the BuildShip Extension
In your Rowy Table, access the extensions menu and add a "**BuildShip Trigger Extension**".

<Image src={rowy4} alt='Rowy Project ID' width={1200} />

### Select Trigger Events

Choose the specific events within Rowy that will trigger the BuildShip extension. You can select from events:

- Create
- Update
- Delete

<Image src={rowy5} alt='Rowy Project ID' width={1200} />

### Specify Required Fields (Optional)

Optionally, you can define the required fields that must be populated to trigger the extension.

### Set Trigger Conditions (Optional)

If needed, add conditions that determine whether the extension should be triggered for a given row.

### Configure BuildShip Trigger

Within the extension body, navigate to the return statement. You'll find the "buildshipConfig" object, which includes
the following fields:

```js
buildshipConfig: {
      projectId: "",
      workflowId: ""
}
```

Replace the placeholder with the configuration details copied from your BuildShip Rowy Trigger. It should look something
like this:

```js
buildshipConfig: {
  projectId: "buildship-008vd0",
  workflowId: "zE49cCs5kBmg7GkUwzLt"
}
```

<Image src={rowy6} alt='Rowy Project ID' width={1200} />

### Save and Deploy

Once you've configured the extension to your requirements, click on "Add" and then deploy the extension.

</Steps>

Now, whenever the selected event (Create, Update, or Delete) occurs in your Rowy Table, it will trigger the BuildShip
workflow linked to this extension.

<br />

## The Request Structure

When the BuildShip Workflow is triggered via the Rowy Extension, it passes the following request body structure:

<Image src={rowy7} alt='Rowy Project ID' width={1200} />

This body structure can then be referenced in different parts of the workflow as variables.

## Updating Rowy Table with the API Response

Once you've configured your Rowy Trigger and the BuildShip Extension on Rowy, let's explore **how to update fields or
add a row in our Rowy table** from our BuildShip Workflow using an example.

In this scenario, we have a Rowy Table containing a list of items. The BuildShip Extension triggers the connected
BuildShip Workflow every time a new item is added or updated.

The triggered workflow employs **OpenAIâ€™s GPT Model** to generate an adjective to describe each item and updates the
adjective column in the Rowy Table accordingly.

To implement this, after setting up the Rowy Extension and Trigger mechanism, proceed to add an OpenAI Text Generator
node.

- Add your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Set the **User Prompt** to `Row.item`.
- Define the **System Prompt** as follows:
  ```
  Generate a unique adjective for a given item. Provide only one word.
  ```

<Image src={rowy8} alt='Rowy Project ID' width={1200} />

**To update the Rowy Table** with the generated adjective, utilize the **Update Firestore Field Value** node. This node
**updates the Firestore Collection associated with your Rowy project**, thereby reflecting changes in the Rowy Table.

<Callout>
  NOTE: To utilize the Firebase/Firestore nodes and connect to your Firebase project, follow the step-by-step guide to
  initiate the connection [here](/tutorials/firebase-project#option-2-connecting-to-your-own-firebase-project).
</Callout>

In the **Update Firestore Field Value** node:

- Enter the same **Project ID** used in the Rowy Trigger.
- Set the **Document Path** input to the variable `Body > Ref > Path`.
- Define the **Field Key** as `adjective` (for this example).
- Pass the output of the OpenAI Text Generator node into the \*\*New Value(()) input.

<Callout type="warning">
The **Return** node does not update the Rowy Table or returns any values in this case as the BuildShip Extension doesn't support returning values to the Rowy Table.

The **Update Firestore Field Value** node has to be used to update the Rowy Table with the response values.
