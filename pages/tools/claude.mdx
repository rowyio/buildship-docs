## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Claude Desktop**

[Download and install Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) for your operating system.

2. **Workflow Shipped**

Use the **"Ship"** button in BuildShip to deploy your workflow.

3. **Node.js & npm**

[Install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if you haven't already.  
After installing, verify with:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

## Adding the MCP Tool to Claude

You have two main options for connecting your BuildShip tool to Claude:

## Option 1: Hosted on BuildShip (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started and is fully managed by BuildShip.

<Steps>
### Open your terminal
Copy and run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npx -y buildship-tools create-mcp-server --project <PROJECT_ID> --flows <FLOW_ID> --apiKey <API_KEY> --token <ID_TOKEN> --outputFolder <TOOL_NAME> --client claude --proxy
```

_Replace the placeholders (`<PROJECT_ID>`, etc.) with your actual values as provided by BuildShip._

### Restart Claude Desktop

If Claude is open, close and reopen it. This loads the new MCP tool.

### Verify Installation

- Open Claude Desktop.
- Look for a **Tool** icon in Claude Chat.
- Try asking Claude to use the tool (e.g., "Summarize Linear changes in the last 3 days").
- When prompted, allow Claude to use the tool.

<Callout>**Tip:** If Claude doesn't prompt to use the tool, try explicitly asking it to use the tool by name.</Callout>

<Callout type='info'>
  **Note:** Since the tool is hosted on BuildShip, executions will use your BuildShip credits.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Option 2: Self-Hosted

For advanced users who want to run the tool locally.

<Steps>

### Open your terminal

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npx -y buildship-tools create-mcp-server --project <PROJECT_ID> --flows <FLOW_ID> --apiKey <API_KEY> --token <ID_TOKEN> --outputFolder <TOOL_NAME> --client claude
```

This will: - Convert your workflow into a JavaScript function. - Download the function to your local machine.

### Connect to Claude

Use the MCP protocol to connect your local server to Claude Desktop.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Permission Prompt:** The first time you use a tool, Claude will ask for permission. Choose **Allow once** or **Allow
  always**.

- **Images & Files:** MCP currently has limited support for passing images/files through Claude. For now, pass images as
  URLs.

- **Community Tools:** Browse or generate tools using BuildShipâ€™s conversational AI. Check the
  [BuildShip tool library](https://buildship.tools) for more examples.
