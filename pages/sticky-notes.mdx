# Sticky Notes

Sticky Notes are an easy way to add notes to your workflows. You can use them to add comments, instructions, or any other information that you want to share with your team.

It makes it easier to document the workflow step-by-step. You can add sticky notes to any part of the workflow canvas. They can also be collapsed to save space.

Another way to document your workflow is by using the [Readme](/readme) feature. Readme pages are a documentation page, where as Sticky Notes are more like post-it notes for your workflow.
