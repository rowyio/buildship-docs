# Together AI Integration

The Together AI integration in BuildShip allows users to seamlessly connect with Together AI’s API to leverage powerful
generative AI capabilities. Users can easily generate embeddings, text completions, and chat-based completions,
incorporating advanced AI models into their workflows with minimal effort. Together AI provides access to 100+
open-source models through its serverless Inference Engine, enabling efficient use of leading models for tasks such as
text generation and embedding creation directly from BuildShip.

By utilizing BuildShip's Together AI nodes, users can simplify the integration of AI-powered features into their
applications. This documentation will guide you through configuring API keys and working with the provided nodes to
fully integrate these AI services.

## Prerequisites ✅

Before you can start using the Together AI Nodes in BuildShip, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### Together AI Account

You will need an active Together AI account to utilize this integration. If you do not have an account, you can create
one at [Together AI](https://together.ai/).

### Together AI API Authentication

You will need a Together AI API Key to authenticate your requests. For more information on obtaining an API Key, refer
to the [Together AI API documentation](https://docs.together.ai/authentication).

<br />

- **API Key**: The Together AI API key is required to authenticate each request you make through the BuildShip nodes.

## Set API Key

Before using any of the Together AI nodes, set your API key for authentication.

### Inputs

- **API Key**: The API key obtained from Together AI for authentication. Make sure to keep it secure.

<Callout>
  You must provide the API key in the headers of each node request. Once set, it allows secure communication with the
  Together AI API.
</Callout>

### Inputs

- **Model**: The AI model that will be used to generate the embeddings. Refer to the
  [Together AI Models](https://api.together.ai/models) for available models.
- **Input**: The text or data for which you want to generate embeddings. This could be a single text input or multiple
  entries (batch processing).

- **API Key**: Your Together AI API Key for authentication.

<Callout>
  Use the "Create Embeddings" node to convert your text or data into numerical embeddings, which can be used for machine
  learning tasks such as clustering, classification, or similarity searches.
</Callout>

### Output

The node returns a set of embeddings based on the input data, which you can further use in your AI or data processing
workflows.

### Inputs

- **Prompt**: The input text that the model will use to generate the completion. This can be anything from a sentence to
  a paragraph.
- **Model**: The model to be used for generating text completions. Refer to the
  [Together AI Models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models) for options.

- **Max Tokens**: The maximum number of tokens (words or subwords) to generate in the completion.

- **API Key**: Your Together AI API Key for authentication.

<Callout>
  Use the "Create Completions" node to generate AI-driven text completions, which can be applied to various tasks such
  as content generation, question-answering, and more.
</Callout>

### Output

The node returns a generated text completion based on the provided prompt and model settings.

## Create Chat Completions

The "Create Chat Completions" node allows you to interact with a chat-based model, where the AI generates a response
based on system and user prompts.

### Inputs

- **System Prompt**: The initial prompt that sets the context for the AI’s behavior or instructions. This helps guide
  the model’s responses.

- **User Prompt**: The user’s input or question, for which the model will generate a reply.

- **Model**: The chat model to be used for generating responses. Refer to the
  [Together AI Chat Models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models) for available options.

- **API Key**: Your Together AI API Key for authentication.

<Callout>
  Use the "Create Chat Completions" node to generate conversational responses from an AI model, useful for chatbots,
  virtual assistants, or interactive AI-driven applications.
</Callout>

### Output

The node returns a generated response based on the input prompts and model configuration. This can be integrated into
chat-based applications or other conversational workflows.
