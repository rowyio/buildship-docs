You can connect your favorite AI-models, tools, API services, and backend in minutes. Extend your workflow's capabilities with JavaScript / TypeScript code and 1M+ NPM packages! 🤯

BuildShip lets you build scalable backend workflows for the apps you build on any stack. Be it a no-code app builder (FlutterFlow, Webflow, Framer, Adalo, Bubble, BravoStudio ...) or 
a frontend framework (Next.js, React, Vue ...) - you can build scalable backend tasks for them in minutes. This means you don't need to wrangle or deploy things on the cloud platform, waiting for long build cycles of cloud functions, perform DevOps, etc.   


No-code friendly but code of every node is accessible and tweakable in javascript/typescript.
Comes with features like instant deploy (no need to wait for long build cycles), version control, multiple projects, copying workflows from one project to another, large number of templates on popular usecases - whatsapp bot, google vision, stripe payment, and so much more.


✨✨ Just Build and Ship, instantly 🚀

### Combine the power of any AI Model
Integrate the leading multimodal AI models and services with your APIs and Workflows like **ChatGPT**, **Stable Diffusion**, **Midjourney**, **DALL-E 2**, and many more.

### The Nodeverse
Explore and select from The Nodeverse, our library of pre-built nodes or generate your own using AI. Tweak the nodes to your liking and build your own custom workflows.

### Build with JavaScript / TypeScript 
Typical low-code, no-code tools use their own complicated formulae process as you start to building anything meaningful. With BuildShip you can build on javascript / typescript - which has lot of reference materials. So you will not get “**stuck**” 😶‍🌫️ in the tool’s features and can build without limits.

### One of a kind development experience
BuildShip provides you with a powerful code editor with autocomplete, localhost like speedy debugging experience, and a sandboxing environment. Build serverless scripts fast, right from your browser! ⚡️ Schedule your function calls, save data to database, connect to any API, use 1M + NPM packages.
