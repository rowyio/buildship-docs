You can connect your favorite AI models, tools, API services, and backend in minutes. Extend your workflow's
capabilities with JavaScript / TypeScript code and 1M+ NPM packages! ü§Ø

BuildShip lets you build scalable backend workflows for the apps you build on any stack. Be it a no-code app builder
(FlutterFlow, Webflow, Framer, Adalo, Bubble, BravoStudio ...) or a frontend framework (Next.js, React, Vue ...) - you
can build scalable backend tasks for them in minutes. This means you don't need to wrangle or deploy things on the cloud
platform, wait for long build cycles of cloud functions, perform DevOps, etc.

No-code friendly but the code of every node is accessible and tweakable in javascript/typescript. Comes with features
like instant deployment (no need to wait for long build cycles), version control, multiple projects, copying workflows
from one project to another, a large number of templates on popular use cases - WhatsApp Bot, Google Vision, Stripe
Payment, and so much more.

### Combine the power of any AI Model

Integrate the leading multimodal AI models and services with your APIs and Workflows like **ChatGPT**, **Stable
Diffusion**, **Midjourney**, **DALL-E 2**, and many more.

### The Nodeverse

Explore and select from The Nodeverse, our library of pre-built nodes or generate your own using AI. Tweak the nodes to
your liking and build your own custom workflows.

### Build with JavaScript / TypeScript

Typical low-code, no-code tools use their own complicated formulae process as you start to build anything meaningful.
With BuildShip you can build on javascript/typescript - which has a lot of reference materials. So you will not get
‚Äú**stuck**‚Äù üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è in the tool‚Äôs features and can build without limits.

### One-of-a-kind development experience

BuildShip provides you with a powerful code editor with autocomplete, localhost-like speedy debugging experience, and a
sandboxing environment. Build serverless scripts fast, right from your browser! ‚ö°Ô∏è Schedule your function calls, save
data to the database, connect to any API and use 1M + NPM packages.
