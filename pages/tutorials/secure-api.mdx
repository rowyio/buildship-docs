As you build, ship, and deploy workflows on BuildShip, it's crucial to ensure the security of your API endpoint when
making it accessible on the internet.

## Using Authorization Header

The Authorization header provides the server with information to authenticate and authorize the client making a request.
It typically contains a token or credentials that the server uses to validate the clientâ€™s identity and grant or deny
access to the requested resource.

You have two options for accessing the Authorization header in your workflows:

<Steps>

### Option 1: Listening for Authorization Header from a request

You can send a request to your workflow endpoint to define the input schema. Then you can easily select the
Authorization header from the request headers. Follow these steps:

1. Send a request to your workflow endpoint with the Authorization header.<br/><br/>
   <Image src={secureAPILinking1} alt='send request' width='1200' /> <br />
2. In BuildShip, select the **Get Data** button to load the request data. Once the data is loaded then you can find the
   Authorization header by expanding the list of available headers.<br/><br/>
   <Image src={secureAPILinking2} alt='get data' width='1200' />
   <br />
3. Click on the **Add input to schema** button to add the Authorization header as an input to your workflow. And that's
   it.<br/><br/>

### Option 2: Manually accessing Authorization Header

You can manually create an input for you workflow to access the Authorization header. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the **Connect Button** at the top to setup the REST API Trigger.
2. Under the Workflow inputs schema section, add a new input. Call it `Authorization` and set the type to String, then
   save.<br/><br/>
   <Image src={secureAPI2} alt='add new input' width='1200' /> <br />
   <br />
3. You can use dot notation to access any header value from the request headers. To begin, update the input to select
   the authorization header from the request headers instead of from the request body: **Select Body > Trigger Data >
   headers > headers** <br/><br/>

   {' '}

### Adding Condition to Validate Header

To enhance security, use a Branch Node to add a condition that validates and verifies the authorization header in the
API request:

- For the first value of the condition select the Authorization input you created earlier. For the comparison, select
  the equals to operator (==). Lastly, set the final value to the key you want to validate.
- Organize your workflow nodes into the "then" and "else" conditions accordingly.

### Return Authorized and Unauthorized Responses

Given an authorized request, it's typical to return an HTTP 200 (OK) response back to the client. Likewise, for an
unauthorized request, return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) response. You can achieve this by setting the **Status Code**
which can be found under the Additional options of the Output node.<br/><br/>

Lastly, you can update the workflow output properties in the trigger settings to return the `Flow Output` for the
response body and the `Flow Output Status Code` for the response status code. 

<br />

<Image src={secureAPI7} alt='Secure-workflow' width='1200' />

1. For setting the Response Body, select **Flow Output > Flow Output**
2. For setting the Response Status Code, select **Local Variables > Flow Output Status Code**

### Congratulations! Your API Endpoint is Now Secured

With the implemented security measures, you can confidently test and ship your workflow, ensuring the endpoint's safe
usage within your application. Your workflow structure should resemble the following after following the above steps:
