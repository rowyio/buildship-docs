**Need help? Use BuildShip's in-app support feature to get assistance directly within the platform.**

If you ever get stuck or need help with anything BuildShip, you can reach out to us using BuildShip's **in-app support**
system. Our support team is here to help you with any questions, issues, or guidance you need while building your
workflows.

## How to Access In-App Support

To submit a **support request** using the **in-app support** feature:

1. Click on the **'Support'** button in the bottom-left corner of the BuildShip interface
2. This will open the **in-app support form** where you can:
   - Submit your message or question
   - Include screenshots to help explain your issue
   - Add video links if you wish to provide visual context
   - Get direct help from our support team

## Including a copy of the workflow

If you're having trouble with a specific workflow, you can include a copy of it in your support request (using the
checkbox at the bottom of the form) for us to take a look. For the checkbox to appear, you must have the workflow open
in the editor before opening the in-app support form.

### Marking inputs as sensitive

To ensure no sensitive data (like an API key) is included in the workflow, any input fields marked 'Sensitive' will be
redacted from the copy of the workflow that is sent to us. You can mark a field as sensitive by following these steps:

<Steps>
### Open the Node Editor for the node whose input(s) you wish to mark as sensitive.
### Switch to the 'Params' tab of the Node Editor and select the input you wish to mark as sensitive.
### Enable the 'Sensitive' toggle for that input if it isn't already enabled.

### Click 'Save' to save your changes.

### Submit in app support request.
