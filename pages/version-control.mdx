# Workflow Version Control

BuildShip provides a version control system that allows you to manage the changes made to your workflows every time the workflow is **Shipped**. This feature enables you to track the history of your workflow, compare different versions, and revert to a previous version if needed.

## Accessing Workflow Versions

To access the version history of a workflow, click on the version control icon in the top bar of the workflow editor. This will open a panel on the right side of the editor, displaying a list of all the versions of the workflow.

Click on a version to view the changes made in that version. You can also restore a previous version by clicking on the **Restore** button.
