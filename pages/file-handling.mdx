# File Handling on BuildShip

BuildShip provides a set of utilities to handle files in your workflows, meant to make it easier to work with files in
your nodes. This includes operations like file conversion (e.g. from a file buffer to a base64 string), simple file
handling (e.g. saving a file to a local path), accessing core properties of a file (e.g. the file name, if available,
and other metadata), and more.

These utilities are present on all valid node input values of type File, right out of the box.

## Supported types

The File input type on BuildShip currently supports the following 4 types of `BuildShipFile`s:

1. **'local-file'**: This type of file lies on the local filesystem. This includes, for example, files that are located
   in your project's storage bucket (since it is mounted to the filesystem).
2. **'external-url'**: This type of file lies at a public external URL. This type by itself doesn't offer much utility,
   so it's recommended to convert it to a more versatile type instead.
3. **'base64'**: This type of file is a base64-encoded string.
4. **'file-buffer'**: This type of file is a NodeJS file buffer.

## How do BuildShipFile instances work?

A `BuildShipFile` instance is automatically created and passed into the node script using the input value supplied to
the node, as long as that input type is set to File. Each kind of instance provides a set of properties and methods,
some unique to the file kind, some common across all kinds.

- One such common property is `type`, which tells you the type of the file.
- Another is the `file` property, which is the actual file itself. This is a `Buffer` for `file-buffer` files, a string
  for `base64` files (the Base 64 encoded string), `local-file` files (the path to the file) and `external-url` files
  (the URL to the file).
- The third common property is `metadata`, which is used to store and preserve any additional properties associated with
  the file.
- The most important common method is `convertTo`, which allows you to convert the file instance to any other supported
  type:
  - First, call the method by passing in the desired type as a string.
  - This will return a callback. You can then call this callback (with any optional arguments it could accept), to get a
    promise that resolves to the new file instance of the desired type.

```tsx
const fileBufferFile = await localFile.convertTo('file-buffer')();
const base64File = await fileBufferFile.convertTo('base64')();
```

<Callout type="info">
When converting any instance to type **'local-file'**, the returned callback can optionally accept a destination path. This path needs to be absolute.

If no path is provided, the file will be saved to the temporary directory with a randomly generated name, and will be
cleaned up once the flow execution is complete.

</Callout>
```tsx
const localFile2 = await base64File.convertTo('local-file')(
    // To place the file at a location relative to the project bucket root
    process.env.BUCKET_FOLDER_PATH + '/path/to/some/file/in/bucket.png',
);
```

The editor's autocomplete should allow you to check out other properties and methods available on each kind of file
instance.

## Tips for building nodes with file inputs

- If nodes are supposed to output a file, returning a valid file object (so either the entire `BuildShipFile` object, or
  _at least_ with `type` and `file` properties, and not just the `file` directly) would make it a lot easier to work
  with things (for example, to allow the output to _directly_ be used as input for the next node).
- You may not always know the type ahead of time (for example, if a node outputs a file, and you use it as input in a
  different node. You may not know what kind the output file is when it's passed to the second node).
  - In such a case (as long as the previous node's output is a valid `BuildShipFile` instance, as mentioned in the
    previous point), simply calling `convertTo` will get you a new instance of the exact type you want.
- BuildShipFile instances will more often than not contain a `mimetype` property within the `metadata` object. This is
  automatically set when the file is created, and is preserved between conversions. It might come in handy when working
  with images, videos and audio files, for example.

## Manually creating a BuildShipFile instance

The `getBuildShipFile` function allows you to create `BuildShipFile` instances within the script as needed.

### Where do I get this function?

```tsx
export default async function (
  { name }: NodeInputs,
  {
    logging,
    env,
    // It's part of NodeScriptOptions and can be destructured here.
    getBuildShipFile,
  }: NodeScriptOptions,
): NodeOutput {
  return name;
}
```

### How do I use it?

It accepts an object of the following form:

```tsx
type BuildShipFileInstantiator = {
  type: 'local-file' | 'external-url' | 'base64' | 'file-buffer';
  file: string | Buffer;
} & { [key: string]: any };
```

and returns a `BuildShipFile` instance. For example:

```tsx
const bsFile = await getBuildShipFile({
  type: 'local-file',
  file: '/path/to/file/in/bucket.png',
  mimetype: 'image/png',
  size: 123456,
});
```

<Callout type='info'>
  Any properties apart from `type` and `file` are preserved in the `metadata` property of the file instance (all
  packaged up into that one object).
</Callout>
