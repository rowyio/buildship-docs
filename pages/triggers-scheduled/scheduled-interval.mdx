The Scheduled Interval Trigger is a versatile feature within BuildShip that **facilitates workflow automation at
regular intervals**. With this trigger, you can **define specific time intervals and units**, allowing you to streamline
tasks and processes based on your requirements.

## How to Use Scheduled Interval Trigger

Configuring the Scheduled Interval Trigger involves the following fields:

- **Interval (Unit in digits)**: Set the **numeric value** that represents the interval at which your workflow should
  trigger.

- **Time Unit**: Choose the appropriate **time unit** (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours) for your interval. This unit
  defines the **duration between successive triggers**.

## Setting up the Scheduled Interval Trigger

To set up a Scheduled Interval Trigger in your BuildShip workflow, follow these steps:

- Go to the **Connect** tab and pick the Interval Schedule (Cron) trigger.

- Configure the fields within the Interval Schedule Trigger. You can choose the desired **Interval**, and **time units** for your trigger as given in the above sections.

    **Example 1: Every 30 Minutes**

    **Interval**: `30`

    **Time Unit**: `Minutes`

    **Description**: This setup triggers the workflow every 30 minutes, making it ideal for tasks that need to be performed multiple times within an hour.

    **Example 2: Hourly Maintenance**

    **Interval**: `1`

    **Time Unit**: `Hours`

    **Description**: This configuration triggers the workflow every hour, allowing you to automate routine maintenance tasks.
