In BuildShip, you have the flexibility to rearrange the order of your logic nodes within your workflows. This is useful
when you want to change the order of execution of your logic nodes.

## How to Reorder Nodes

<Steps>
### Access the Workflow Navigation Panel

On the left-hand side of the BuildShip interface, you'll find the Workflow Navigation Panel. This panel displays all the
nodes in your workflow in their current order.

### Drag and Drop

To rearrange the nodes, simply click and hold on the node you want to move. Drag it to the desired position within the
panel. As you drag and drop the nodes in the navigation panel, you'll notice that the nodes automatically adjust to
their new order. This mirrors the order you've set in the navigation panel within your workflow.

  Triggers are the starting points of workflows, and thus cannot be reordered. Their sequence remains fixed. Only logic
  nodes can be rearranged as needed.
