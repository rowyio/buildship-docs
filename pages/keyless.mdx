Leverage the latest AI models without worrying about paying for multiple services or acquiring API keys for different resources. 

Keyless nodes provide a versatile solution that **works even without providing keys**, or alternatively, you can **bring your own keys** for greater control over your resources.

## Using Keyless Nodes

Keyless nodes are designed to be **plug-and-play**, meaning you can use them without the need for any API keys. 

Navigate to the **Node Explorer** and look for the special **Keyless Markers** by clicking on the Node Info button. These markers indicate that the node can be used without requiring any API keys.

For starters, you can search for `AI Chat` in the Node Explorer to find the keyless nodes. These AI Chat nodes are available for most of the popular AI models, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Perplexity, and more.

Once the node is added to your workflow, you can start using it right away: 

- Click on "Key" icon located in the node menu bar
- Find and select the multi-colored key labeled "Use Credits"

Now you can start using the node without any API keys, via node testing, workflow testing  or in production.

- The node will automatically use the credits from your BuildShip account to pay for the resources used in the workflow.

Using keyless nodes allows you to focus on building rather than managing API keys across multiple platforms.


## Bring Your Own Keys with Keyless Nodes

While keyless nodes offer convenience, you may prefer to use your own API keys for certain services. This approach gives you greater control and can reduce credit usage for your project.

To use your own keys with keyless-compatible nodes:

- Click on the "Key" icon on the node menu bar
- Either select a previously added key or click the "Add Key" button to securely save a new one to be used with the service across your project.
