# Using Variables in Workflows

Learn how to use context variables, HTTP request components, and output values from other nodes in your workflow logic.

## Using Incoming HTTP Request Components

  This is only applicable while using REST API Trigger node.
</Callout>

When working with the REST API Call Trigger, you can leverage various request components like **Headers**, **Params**, and the **Request Body** to efficiently pass data to your logic nodes.

### Accessing Request Variables

- Use the "**Expression Editor**" to select the request variables.

- Inside the **Expression Editor**, click on "**Insert Variable**" dropdown to browse and select from the available request variables.

**Extracting a specific value from a Request Variable**

Let's consider an example where we want to retrieve the `collectionName` variable from the request body. To do this, we can:
- In the **Expression Editor**, pick the Request Body variable from the "**Insert Variable**" dropdown.
- To access the specific value, add the key in one of the following formats:
    - `["collectionName"]`
    - `.collectionName`

</Callout>


## Using Output values from other nodes

When you have previously returned values from your logic nodes, you can access them conveniently through the **Expression Menu** `(x)`. To access a specific output, **click on the name of the node** associated with the desired output, and then **select your output variable**. This allows you to conveniently leverage the output values in your current workflow logic.
