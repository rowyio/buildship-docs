A workflow is a **visual representation of a logical sequence of tasks** designed to achieve a specific goal. Each task is represented by a node, and workflows are constructed to automate processes, streamline tasks, and efficiently respond to various events.

**Key characteristics of workflows include:**

- **Trigger Nodes:** The first node is a trigger that initiates the workflow
- **Nodes:** Each node represents a specific task or action within the workflow
- **Return Nodes:** The last node can be a return statement, providing optional final outputs

## How to build a Workflow?

Here's a comprehensive guide to building a workflow using BuildShip:

<Steps>
### Create a new workflow

*Begin by initiating a new workflow on the BuildShip dashboard.*

Navigate to the BuildShip dashboard and click on the "**New Workflow**" button.

### Adding Triggers

*Triggers initiate workflows based on specific events.*

Click on the "**Add a Trigger**" button within your newly created workflow.
Select from the list of existing triggers, such as [HTTP Requests](/rest-api), [Scheduled Intervals](/scheduled-interval), or [Cron Jobs](/scheduled-cron).

### Adding Logic Nodes

*Logic nodes perform tasks and actions within your workflow.*

Explore the Nodeverse, which offers a variety of pre-built nodes for data processing, communication, and more.
Select nodes that align with the tasks you want to accomplish.

You could also create your own custom nodes using the "**Generate with AI**" feature from **the Nodeverse**.

### Configuring the Nodes

With BuildShip's low-code capabilities, configuring each node is a user-friendly process that empowers you to tailor your workflow to your exact requirements. Here's how you can do it:

- Click on the **Script Icon** on the node to open the **Node Editor**. 
- Personalize the node's behavior according to your specific needs by manipulating the Node Logic, Input Params, Output, as well as the Node Description.

### Returning data from the Workflow

*Optionally, include a return statement at the end of your workflow.*

The return statement provides output values that can be used for further processing or as a response.
