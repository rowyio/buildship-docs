There are 2 easy ways to rename a workflow:

## 1. Renaming from Workflow Canvas

Open your workflow and **double click on the workflow name**. This will let you edit the workflow name **right from your
workflow canvas**.

Once you are done, **click anywhere outside to save the changes**.

## 2. Renaming via Workflow Settings

Open the **Workflow Menu (â–¿)** next to the workflow name, and click on **Settings**. In the Workflow Settings you can
edit the name of your workflow and even add an optional description.

Once you are done, click **Save** to save the changes.
