Welcome to **Buildship Tools**—the fastest way to create, test, and deploy powerful, portable tools for your AI agents.

Whether you're building for Claude, ElevenLabs, Cursor, or any framework, Buildship enables you to visually design,
tweak, and ship MCP-ready tools in minutes.

No more code blobs—just clear logic flows on an infinite low-code canvas, with robust code export and self-hosting
options.

## What Are Buildship Tools?

**BuildShip.Tools** enables you to build, test, and deploy AI agent tools using a visual, no-code/low-code canvas, or by
writing code directly. Tools are **MCP-compatible** (Multi-Call Protocol), making them portable across AI agent
platforms.

<Callout type='info'>Tools are designed to be agent-agnostic—build once, use anywhere.</Callout>

- **Create**: Build tools with plain language prompts, visual flows, or code.
- **Host**: Instantly deploy as secure endpoints for agents.
- **Share**: Publish to the community or export code to self-host.

## Core Features

- **Prompt-to-Tool**: Describe the tool you want; BuildShip sketches the flow.
- **Visual Canvas**: Drag, drop, and connect nodes for logic, APIs, and services.
- **Low-Code Customization**: Edit any node’s code directly.
- **AI Compass**: Visualize and modify workflows with conversational AI.
- **Testing & Logging**: Test every node, save examples, and view logs.
- **Version Control**: Rollback and manage tool versions.
- **RBAC & Security**: Role-based access, OAuth, API keys, JWT, multi-environment support.
- **Instant Deploy or Export**: Host on BuildShip or export to your own infra.
- **Community Library**: Use and remix pre-built tools.

## Creating Your First Tool

<Steps>
### Go to Buildship Tools
Visit [Buildship Tools](https://buildship.tools), sign in or create a new Buildship account by clicking on **Get Started**.

### Create a New Tool

Use the **prompt input** to describe your tool in natural language (e.g., "Given a logo image, apply a 3D texture and
return the result").

### Start Building using AI Compass

Select your workspace and click **"Start Building"** to begin creating your tool.

BuildShip will generate a **visual logic flow**:

- Input nodes (e.g., image URL)
- Service/API nodes (e.g., image generator, API calls)
- Logic/validation nodes
- Output nodes (e.g., return final image)

<Image src={compass} alt='AI Compass Overview' width={1200} />

_You can:_

- **Accept** the design as-is
- **Tweak** nodes, connections, or logic

<Callout type='tip'>Use clear input/output descriptions for best results when creating your tool.</Callout>

</Steps>

## Building with AI Compass

The canvas displays:

- **Input nodes** (e.g., image URL)
- **Processing nodes** (e.g., image generator, API calls)
- **Output nodes** (e.g., return final image)

You can:

- Edit nodes visually
- Dive into the code for any node
- Add, remove, or connect nodes as needed
- Use the AI assistant to modify flows or write code

**Example:**  
A tool that merges a logo onto a textured image:

- Input: Logo URL, Texture URL
- Steps: Download images → Merge → Output new image URL

### Deploying & Connecting Tools

<Steps>
### One-Click Deploy

- Click **“Deploy”** to host your tool instantly.
- BuildShip will create a secure MCP endpoint.
- Ready for agent connection (Claude, Cursor, ElevenLabs, etc.).

### Generate API Key

- In the **Connect** tab, generate a secure **API key**.
- Copy the MCP endpoint or OpenAPI spec.

### Connect to Your Agent

Access **MCP integration instructions** for your agent framework (e.g., Claude).

- Use the provided **npx** command or API endpoint.
- Follow step-by-step integration instructions in the Connect tab.

</Steps>

## Exporting & Self-Hosting

- Click **“Export as Function”** or use the CLI command:

```bash
npx buildship-tools export <tool-id>
```

- Download the tool's code and deploy on your own infrastructure.
- **No lock-in**: Self-host for compliance or custom needs.

## Tool Publishing & Community

<Image src={exportTool} alt='Export Tool' width={1200} />

<Steps>
### Publish Your Tool
Share your tools in the Buildship community library.

### Add Examples

Include examples and categories for better discoverability. Add a description, tags, and categories to help others find
your tool.

### Remix Tools

Browse the [BuildShip Tool Library](https://buildship.tools/library) for reusable tools. Click “Remix” to clone and
customize.

### Showcase Work

Display your published tools and contributions on your profile.
