Being a part of the BuildShip community means more than just using tools it means contributing to them. With Community
Nodes, you can extend the power of BuildShip and share your ideas with builders across the world.

This guide walks you through what community nodes are, how to build them effectively, and how to share your creations
with the wider BuildShip ecosystem.

## What are Community Nodes?

Community Nodes are custom nodes created by BuildShip users that expand the platform‚Äôs functionality. Once submitted,
these nodes become part of the shared Community Library, enabling others to use, remix, or build upon them.

## Prerequisites ‚úÖ

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- A [BuildShip Community Profile](/tools-templates#create-a-creator-profile)
- A basic understanding of how to create nodes in BuildShip (No worries if you're new, BuildShip Compass - our
  chat-based building experience can help you build and edit nodes easily!)

## Best Practices for creating a Node üõ†Ô∏è

Creating a node for the community is a little different from creating one just for your own project. Here are a few best
practices to keep in mind:

<Steps>

### Check for Uniqueness

Browse the existing Community Nodes Library to avoid duplicating functionality. You can find the Community Nodes Library
in the Node Explorer's "Community" tab.

### Write Clear Documentation

Make it easy for others to use your node:

- Add meaningful descriptions to all inputs and outputs

- Use accurate type definitions

- Include usage examples in the node description

- Mention any external setup steps or dependencies

### Follow Security Best Practices

Community nodes should never include sensitive information or unsafe logic. Make sure your code:

- Doesn‚Äôt hardcode tokens or secrets

- Avoids unsafe external dependencies

- Handles errors gracefully

### Set Node Metadata Thoughtfully

Good metadata improves discoverability:

- Choose a descriptive, readable name

- Write a clear summary of what your node does

- Pick the right key-based or OAuth authentication method based on your node's needs

**Node Integrations and Authentication**

To use the key-based authentication behavior for your node:

1. Pick the required integration from the node settings
2. Make sure to add `auth` as a dependency from the `NodeScriptOptions`

```typescript
export default async function ({ videoUrl }: NodeInputs, { auth, logging }: NodeScriptOptions) {
  // this would let you access the key user has selected in the canvas
  const apiKey = auth.getKey();
}
```

To use the OAuth authentication behavior for your node:

1. Pick the required integration from the node settings
2. Make sure to add `auth` as a dependency from the `NodeScriptOptions`

```typescript
export default async function ({ videoUrl }: NodeInputs, { auth, logging }: NodeScriptOptions) {
  // this would let you access the token for the account user has selected in the canvas
  const { access_token } = await auth.getToken();
}
```

</Callout>

### Test Thoroughly

You're creating something others will rely on so make sure it works:

- Save working examples in your node

- Test with different inputs, edge cases, and error scenarios

- Confirm the output is consistent and correct

</Steps>

## Submitting Your Node üì§

When your node is polished and ready for the spotlight, here‚Äôs how to submit it:

<Steps>

### 1. Open the Node Menu

In the node editor, click the options menu (three dots) and select "Publish to Community."

### 2. Pass Submission Checks

<Image src={presubmissionChecks} alt='Pre-submission Checks' width={1200} />

To maintain quality across the community, your node must:

- Include complete documentation

- Have at least one working example saved

- Pass automated validation checks

These steps ensure your node is usable by others and behaves reliably.

### 3. Fill Out the Submission Form

<Image src={nodeSubmission} alt='Node Submission Form' width={1200} />

You'll be prompted to:

- Confirm the node's name and description

- Specify types for inputs/outputs

- Add notes on setup, authentication, or limitations

### 4. Review and Approval

After submission, the BuildShip team will review your node. Once approved, it will appear in the Community Nodes Library
for everyone to use and remix!
