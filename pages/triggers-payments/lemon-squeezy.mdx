### Secret Key

The string used by Lemon Squeezy to sign requests for increased security. This key is required for verifying the
authenticity of the incoming requests.

### Store ID

The ID of the store for which you want to set up the webhook. This ID should match the Store ID you obtained from the
Settings > Stores section in the Lemon Squeezy Dashboard. (Refer to the [prerequisites](#prerequisites-) section for
more information)

## Trigger Outputs

Once the trigger is correctly configured and shipped, users will be able to access the following outputs:

- **Parsed Payload:** The parsed JSON payload of the incoming webhook event.
- **Raw Payload:** The raw, unparsed payload of the incoming webhook event.

These outputs can be accessed as variables using the Context Menu in the BuildShip Editor.

<Image src={lemon3} alt='Lemon Squeezy Trigger Outputs' width={1200} />

## Webhook Security

The Lemon Squeezy Trigger uses **HMAC-SHA256 signatures** to ensure the authenticity of incoming webhook requests. The
provided Secret Key is used to validate the signature included in the request headers. This mechanism ensures that only
legitimate requests from Lemon Squeezy are processed by the trigger, enhancing the overall security of your workflows.

## Example Use Cases

Use Cases The Lemon Squeezy Trigger can be utilized in various scenarios to automate and streamline your workflows. Here
are some interesting use cases:

- **Order Processing:** Configure the trigger to listen for the `order_created` or `order_refunded` events, and then
  create a workflow to automatically update your inventory management system, send order confirmation emails, or
  initiate shipment processes.

- **Subscription Management:** Set up the trigger to respond to `subscription_created`, `subscription_updated`,
  `subscription_cancelled`, or other subscription-related events, and create workflows to sync subscription data with
  your billing system, send notifications to customers, or trigger marketing campaigns based on subscription changes.
