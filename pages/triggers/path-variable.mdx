# Rest API Path Variables

In BuildShip, you can define dynamic parts of the path using named parameters, often called wildcards or path variables.
This allows you to create flexible and reusable API endpoints.

Path variables are only available for the Rest API type triggers. [Learn more](/triggers#rest-api-triggers)

## Setting Up Path Variables

To set up a path variable in the REST API trigger configuration, specify the Path and Method. For dynamic paths, use a
named parameter by prefixing it with a colon (`:`).

### Example Configuration

- **Path**: `/api/call/:id`
- **Method**: `GET` (or `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` depending on your requirement)

With this configuration, if a request is made to a URL like `https://myproject.buildship.run/api/call/123`, the workflow
associated with this path will be triggered. The variable part, `123`, is captured by `:id`.

## Accessing Path Variables

We can access the path variable while setting up the workflow inputs in the trigger configuration.

You can access the path variable using the `params` object. To extract the `id` from the path, you can use the following expression:

</Callout>

## Wildcard Use Cases

Path variables are useful when you want to create a single workflow that can handle multiple requests based on the path.


### Multiple Path Variables

We could have multiple path variables in a single path. For example, `/users/:userId/posts/:postId`. In this case, the workflow will be triggered when a request is made to a URL like `https://myproject.buildship.run/users/123/posts/456`.


Here's how you can access multiple path variables in the trigger configuration:

<Image src={multiplePathVariable} alt='Multiple Path Variables' width={1200} />


### Catch-all wildcard (*)

You can also use a catch-all wildcard (`*`) to match any path. For example, `/api/*`. This will match any path starting with `/api/`.
