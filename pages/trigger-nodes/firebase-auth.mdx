The Firebase Authenticated User Trigger facilitates seamless API Calls to BuildShip from a Web Client. Leveraging the
user's ID token as the authentication key, it automatically rejects unauthenticated requests, ensuring robust security
measures.

This mechanism ensures that only authenticated users of your application can send requests to your API endpoint.

## Prerequisites ✅

- **A Frontend Application / Web Client integrated with Firebase Authentication**. Users must pass the end-user's **ID
  token** in the headers to authenticate the request.

## Understanding the Mechanism

This trigger functions similar to the [REST API Call Trigger](./rest-api). It necessitates a **POST** Request sent to
the **Endpoint URL** provided by the Firebase Auth Trigger config. The Request Structure is outlined below:

### Request Method

A **POST** Request is mandatory for the Endpoint URL provided by the Firebase Auth Trigger. This URL can be retrieved
from the **Firebase Authenticated User Trigger configuration**.

### Request Headers

The request headers must include the **Authorization Header**, where the value should be the user’s ID Token received
post successful user authentication within your Web Client. Additionally, the **Content-Type** should be set to
`application/json`.

For more details about Firebase ID Tokens, refer to the documentation
[here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#web).

For testing purposes, users can conveniently copy and paste their token from the network tab.

</Callout>

**SAMPLE INPUT**:

```
Authorization: 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZC...',
'Content-Type': 'application/json'
```

### Request Body

Users have the option to pass any desired **data to be accessed within the Workflow** associated with the Firebase Auth
Trigger. This data format must adhere to a **JSON Object**.

**SAMPLE INPUT**:

```
{
	"key1": "value1",
	"key2": "value2"
}
```

Here’s an example demonstrating a similar request using the API Call Node in BuildShip. However, for actual
implementation, this request must be made through the client application.

## The Firebase Authenticated User Trigger

In a blank workflow, click on “**Add Trigger**” button and select the “**Firebase Authenticated User**” trigger.

The **Project ID** input is required for configuring the trigger for your project.

### Firebase Project ID

Users must specify the **Firebase Project ID utilized by their client application**. This trigger initializes
authentication and validates the token passed in the request.

<Callout type='info'>
  If no Project ID is provided, the Trigger employs the default Project ID linked with your BuildShip Project.
</Callout>

## Trigger Outputs

Once the trigger is correctly configured, users will be able to access the Request Body passed via the POST Request made
to the endpoint, along with the Firebase User details.

The Firebase User Details include the Display Name, Photo URL, Email, and UID.

All these outputs can be accessed as variables using the Context Menu in the Editor.

## Example Workflow

Consider a scenario where we aim to generate custom tokens for users whose emails end with a specific domain, such as
`@buildship.com`. Let's outline the steps for achieving this:

<Image src={fbAuth7} alt='Firebase Authenticated User Trigger' width={1200} />

<Steps>

### Firebase Authenticated User Trigger

Add the Project ID associated with the client that authenticates the user and generates the ID Token.

### Branch Node

Set up a Branch node in the workflow to evaluate whether the Firestore User Email includes @buildship.com. Paste the
following condtion in the Editor:

```
ctx["root"]["firebase-trigger"]["user"]["email"].includes("@buildship.com")
```

<Image src={fbAuth6} alt='Firebase Authenticated User Trigger' width={1200} />

### Conditional Workflow Execution

If the user's email matches the condition (`@buildship.com`), proceed with generating a custom Firebase Token for the
user's UID.

If the condition is not met, return a response with a status code of 401 - Unauthorized Request.

</Steps>

This workflow ensures that only users with email addresses ending in @buildship.com receive custom Firebase Tokens,
allowing controlled access to specific functionalities or resources within the application.
