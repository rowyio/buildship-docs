# Firebase File Upload Trigger

The Firebase Auth File Upload Trigger is designed to handle incoming HTTP requests with multipart/form-data content
type, which is commonly used for file uploads.

However, before processing the file upload, the trigger verifies if the request is coming from an authenticated user by
checking the Authorization header for a valid Firebase ID token.

If the token is valid, the trigger proceeds to parse the request body and extract the uploaded file along with its
metadata. The file is then stored in a buffer, which can be used for further processing or storage.

  If you're looking for a more general-purpose file upload trigger without verification, you can use the [File Upload
  Trigger](/trigger-nodes/file-upload) instead.

## Input Request Structure

The Upload File Trigger allows you to specify a **Path**, **Method**, and a **Project ID** for the trigger. The **Path**
is the URL endpoint where the trigger will listen for incoming requests. The **Method** is the HTTP method that the
trigger will listen for. The **Project ID** is the ID of the Firebase project that the trigger will use to verify the ID
token. Leave empty to use default project associated with your BuildShip Workspace.

The trigger expects an HTTP request with the following structure:

- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
- **Method:** `POST` or `PUT`
- **Headers:** The request should contain an `Authorization` header with a valid Firebase ID token.
- **Body:** The request body should contain the file data and any additional form fields.

The request body is parsed using the `multer` library, which is a middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` in
Node.js.

## Output

The trigger produces the following output:

- **file:** An object containing the uploaded file and its metadata, including:

  - `fieldname`: The name of the field containing the file in the form data.
  - `originalname`: The original name of the file on the user's computer.
  - `mimetype`: The MIME type of the file.
  - `buffer`: A Buffer (Node.js) containing the entire file data.
  - `size`: The size of the file in bytes.
  - `encoding`: The encoding type of the file.

- **body:** An object containing any additional form fields submitted with the request.
- **headers:** An object containing the request headers.

## Authentication

Before processing the file upload, the trigger verifies the provided Firebase ID token by calling the `verifyIdToken`
method from the Firebase Admin SDK. If the token is valid, the trigger proceeds with the file upload process. If the
token is invalid or missing, an error is thrown with an "Unauthorized request" message.

  The Firebase Auth File Upload Trigger is designed to verify the Firebase ID token before processing the file upload.
  Learn more on how to add the Firebase ID token to the request (or for testing) in the [Firebase Authentication Trigger
  - Request Headers](/trigger-nodes/firebase-auth#request-headers).

## Usage

Here's a basic template that can be cloned and used as a starting point. This example demonstrates how to use the
Firebase File Upload Trigger to verify and handle incoming file uploads and save the file to the BuildShip Cloud Storage
to get back a public URL.

## Testing

You can test the Firebase Auth File Upload Trigger using tools like Postman or Hoppscotch. Here's an example of how to
test it using Postman:

1. Open Postman and create a new request.
2. Set the request method to **POST** or **PUT**.
3. Enter the endpoint URL in the request URL field.
4. In the "Headers" tab, add a new header with the key "Authorization" and the value `Bearer <Firebase ID Token>`.
   Replace `<Firebase ID Token>` with a valid Firebase ID token for an authenticated user.
5. In the **Body** tab, select the `form-data` option.
6. Click the "Choose File" button and select the file you want to upload.
7. If you have additional form fields, you can add them under the "form-data" section.
8. Click the "Send" button to submit the request.

If the request is successful and the provided Firebase ID token is valid, you should see the response from the trigger
containing the file buffer and metadata. If the token is invalid or missing, you should see an "Unauthorized request"
error.
