# OpenAPI Specification

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';
import { Steps } from 'nextra/components';
import Video from '../components/video/index.jsx';

The OpenAPI Specification is a comprehensive, human-readable, and machine-readable format used to define RESTful APIs.

It serves as a detailed documentation source that outlines various aspects of the API, including its methods,
operations, responses, parameters, schemas, and more.

This specification is documented in a structured series of key-value pairs following the OpenAPI structure, enabling
developers to understand and interact with the API effectively.

## Exporting Open API Specification

BuildShip lets you export the entire structure and details of the APIs built, making it convenient for integration with
various frontend applications, such as FlutterFlow.

BuildShip allows users to export the OpenAPI Specification in two common formats:

- JSON
- YAML

<Callout type='info'>
  While JSON remains the standard format for OpenAPI, BuildShip also provides support for the simpler YAML
  representation, offering flexibility in the choice of export format.
</Callout>

## How to export OpenAPI Specification

To export the OpenAPI Specification, follow the steps below:

- Once you have the API workflow you wish to export, navigate to the Project Settings.

- Move to the "APIs" tab and select the specific workflow(s) for exporting.

- Utilize the dropdown menu available on the top right of the section to select the preferred format for exporting the
  API Spec â€“ JSON or YAML.

- Clicking on the export option initiates the download process, providing users with a file containing the generated API
  Specification in the chosen format.

## Importing API Specification

<Callout type='warning' emoji='ðŸš§'>
  This feature is currently under development and expected to be available soon.

The Importing API Specification will enable users to create nodes and workflows by importing OpenAPI Specifications
directly into BuildShip.

This feature simplifies the process of building workflows based on external specifications.

## How to import API Specification

- Copy the entire API Specification file from the source.

- Navigate to the Node Library within BuildShip.

- Click on the "Import Open API from clipboard" feature to initiate the import process.

This action adds nodes to the workflow according to the schema defined in the imported API Spec. Users can then manage
these nodes by copying them for reuse in other workflows/projects or deleting any nodes that are unnecessary.
