# Creating Nodes

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components';

Here's a quick creation guide and a checklist reference for creating nodes in BuildShip. This guide ensures creating meaningful nodes and ensuring a good user experience.

## Check #1: Node Script

<Steps>

### Clean Code with Explicit Comments
Ensure that you're creating a node which is easily readable/modifiable for anybody who wishes to tweak. A few pointers to take care of:

- Descriptive variables
- Break complex logic into simpler, re-usable functions
- Clear meaningful comments
- Handle edge cases with meaningful error messages
- Minimalistic approach

### Using BuildShip Utilities

BuildShip provides utility functions right out of the box which provides functionalities like: logging, file handling, and authentication.

Utility functions are imported as part of the second parameter provided to the main function in the node, using the type `NodeScriptOptions`.

#### Logging (`logging`)

Can be used anywhere inside the function definition as `logging.log()` just how we use a `console.log()`.

<Callout>
`console.log()` doesn't work in the node scripts. Please use `logging.log()` statements for the logs to show up in the [Cloud Logs](https://docs.buildship.com/logging).
</Callout>

<Callout>
**NOTE:** Logs for individual node testing does not show up in the cloud logs. To see the logs for individual nodes, execute them as part of workflow testing.
</Callout>


#### BuildShip File Handling (`useBuildShipFile`)
    
Use the dedicated File type & File Handling system by BuildShip instead of the native file handling techniques. Check out the complete documentation [here](https://docs.buildship.com/file-handling).


#### Authentication (`auth`)

In case the nodes requires authentication for an integration / an API call, BuildShip supports two types of authentication options:

##### 1. API Key (Key-based Integrations)
    
Imagine building a new node for an integration such as OpenAI. We use key-based integrations for all groups - where users can add multiple keys for a single group. 

Making the new node as part of the group lets users re-use the existing nodes they've added for all the nodes belonging to the group, i.e. OpenAI.

To do this, we need to follow the two steps below:

**STEP #1: Assign a Group**

- Navigate to the Settings section in the Node Editor
- In the Key-based Integration selector, select the Integration Group for the node to be a part of
- In case an existing integration does not exist, click on the “Create New Integration” option and instantly create a new one

**STEP #2: Using the Selected Key**

- Make sure that `auth` is being imported from the `NodeScriptOptions` in the primary function parameters
- Inside the function, do the following to use the API Key. This way, we do not need to add an additional input to add the API Key.

```js
export default async function textToSpeech(
  { text }: NodeInputs,
  { logging, auth }: NodeScriptOptions){
	  const apiKey = auth.getKey();
	  
	  // use this apiKey as part of the request authentication
  }
```

##### 2. OAuth Token

BuildShip offers OAuth-based authentication for the listed services. To check out, navigate to the Settings section in the Node Editor. Look for the OAuth Integration selector to see all the supported integrations.

If you'd like an OAuth integration for a new service, click on the “Request New OAuth” option and let us know!

**USING THE OAUTH INTEGRATION**

The OAuth integration gives us the Access Token for the authenticated account. Here's how you can access it:

```js
export default async function textToSpeech(
  { text }: NodeInputs,
  { logging, auth }: NodeScriptOptions){
	  const { access_token } = await auth.getToken();
	  
	  // use this access_token as part of the request authentication
  }
```
</ Steps>


## Check #2: Inputs

### Good Descriptions

- Use simple language
- Use clear, everyday terms.
- Avoid jargon when possible

### Required / Sensitive Fields

<Callout>
**REQUIRED FIELDS:** Inputs which are absolutely necessary for a node's execution.
Purpose: Enforce validation - throws an error if the value for these inputs are not present.
For example: the table name for an SQL node, or the Host URL for a Meilisearch node.
</Callout>

<Callout>
**SENSITIVE FIELDS:** Inputs which have sensitive values. 
Purpose: Does not log these values in the cloud logs ensuring privacy. Also, helpful in hiding the values in case you submit a support request.
For example: An additional secret token which is additional to the API Key.
</Callout>

### Default Values / Placeholder

It is always good to provide some default for the fields, so they can directly be tested.

In case, we cannot set good defaults for an input, for example: `collectionName` for a Firebase node, add a placeholder.

### Clearing the Clutter

- **Accept user-friendly inputs**
    
Lets say we are creating a Google Sheet node which requires the Sheet ID. This is how the Sheet ID is embedded in the URL:

```js
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/sheetID/edit?gid=someRandomID#gid=anotherRandomID
```

In this case, it is **difficult for a user** to recognize which value to pick and add. Instead, we could have a simpler input to **let user add the complete URL** and extract the Sheet ID internally in the script.


- **Highlight essential options, hide optional settings**
    
Having multiple customization inputs is helpful, but increases complexity and feels overwhelming. To reduce this visual clutter, always have optional / inputs having good default values (like Model ID, or ones with set default values) hidden inside a Folder.

<Callout>
**Ask yourself:** "What's the minimum information needed to make this work?" Then, hide everything else behind a collapsed section or within the code to let Expert users to fill in.
</Callout>


### Check #3: Output & Examples

It's super simple to update the output schema for a node. Once the node is ready to test, use the testing panel to check if the node works correctly.

Once you get a successful response, look for the **“Update Output”** button to automatically update the Output Schema based on the response received.

To save examples for your node, look for the “Save Example” button to save the testing Input values and Result as an example to showcase for the community.

<Callout>
**NOTE:** You need at least 1 example saved to make a submission.
</Callout>

### Check #4: Settings

- Use a crisp and appropriate Node Name and Description which clearly describes the purpose of the node
- Add appropriate integrations - Key-based & OAuth

<Callout>
**NOTE:** For making a submission, we can **safely ignore the Node ID and Icons** here. We can **set the icons while submitting the node** in the form. After submission, the node in the canvas would be automatically updated to match the submitted node.
