# Rename Nodes

BuildShip allows you to rename nodes in your workflow to improve readability and debugging experience while building
workflows.

## How to Rename Nodes

To rename a node in your BuildShip workflow, follow these simple steps:

1. Locate the node you want to rename in your BuildShip workflow.
2. Click on the existing name of the node to enter edit mode.
3. Type in the new name for the node.
4. Click anywhere outside the node to save the new name.

## Usage

### Readability

One of the main reasons to rename nodes is to improve the readability of your workflow. For example, if you add an empty
script node to create your own logic, you can rename the default "Empty Node" to a more descriptive name that reflects
its purpose.

### Debugging

The logs from each node in your workflow appear in the Logs panel, along with the node's name. Renaming nodes can help
you create more meaningful log statements, which can be incredibly useful for debugging purposes. For instance, if you
have a switch node with multiple cases, each containing a "Log Message to Console" node, you can rename each node to
indicate which switch case it belongs to, making the log statements more informative.
