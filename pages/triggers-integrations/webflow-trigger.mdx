# Webflow Trigger

The Webflow Trigger lets you automate and collect valuable customer data and valuable insights from your Webflow Sites based on the subscribed event. Pick from a wide range of available trigger events like form submissions, site publishing, page, e-commerce, CMS collections and user account related events.

## Trigger Configuration

Once you've selected your Webflow Account for the website, and added your Webflow Site ID, all you need to do is **pick the trigger event you wish to subscribe to**.

In case of the `form_submission` trigger event, we have the option to add a filter for the form (in case of multiple forms) we want the webhook payload events to be sent for.

Here's a sample value for the filter field:

```JSON
{
  "name": "The name of the form you'd like to recieve notifications for"
}
```

## Connection and Testing

Once the basic configuration is done, click on the “**Connect**” button. If connected successfully, the button shows success.

This means that a webhook should have been successfully set up for your Webflow Site.

To test, you can go to the [Webflow Dashboard](https://webflow.com/dashboard/) > **Apps and Integrations**, and check if a webhook has been created with the same endpoint as specified in the post-connection preview, along with the same event subscriptions.

## Input / Output Mapping and Get Data

You can map your Webflow Trigger payload for the subscribed events to be passed as inputs to your workflow. Webflow sends a different structure of payload for different events.

You can also use the `Get Data` button to fetch the latest data from the Webflow API for the selected event type. To use this feature, we just need to trigger the specified event, for example: create a new form submission in your linked Webflow Form to trigger the `form_submission` event.

This trigger does not have any output mapping as it is an event-based trigger.
