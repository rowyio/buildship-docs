# YouTube Trigger

The YouTube Trigger is an OAuth-based **scheduled trigger** that **periodically checks a specified YouTube channel for
new video uploads**, fetches the details of any newly published videos, and returns those video details along with an
updated snapshot of the channel's state.

Now easily automate workflows that need to be **triggered when a new video is uploaded to a YouTube channel**. For
example, use the YouTube Trigger to **automatically share new video links on social media, send notifications to your
team, or update a database with video details**.

## Authentication

The YouTube Trigger **uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate with the YouTube API**. When you add a YouTube Trigger to your
workflow, you will be prompted to authenticate with your Google account and grant the necessary permissions to the
trigger.
