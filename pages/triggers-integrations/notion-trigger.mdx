# Notion Trigger

Notion Trigger integrates with your Notion workspace to trigger workflows when a button is clicked in a Notion page. This can be used to send data from Notion to BuildShip or to trigger a workflow in BuildShip when a specific action is performed in Notion.

## Setting up the Notion Trigger

Before creating a connection between Notion and BuildShip, create a workflow in BuildShip that you want to trigger from Notion.

> Start fast with the [Notion to Dev.to Blog template](https://app.buildship.com/template/QFqqgTOCUP9F).

## Connecting Notion to BuildShip

This trigger requires to set up the Notion Hook for your workspace. 

<Callout type='info'>
Read the entire documentation for setting up the Notion Hook Chrome Extension [here](/https://buildship.notion.site/Notion-Hook-e04872e7009a4d58b80436f34b59ae68). Learn how to override the buttons in Notion to trigger workflows in BuildShip with additional settings.

You can follow the steps below to set up the Notion Hook:

<Steps>

### Set up a Webhook Action on Notion

Add a custom button to your Notion database using the `/button` shortcut command. Click "**Edit Automation**" and select the action "**Send Webhook**".

<br />
<Image src={notionHook} alt='Notion Hook' width={1200} />

Paste the endpoint URL provided by the Notion Trigger into the Webhook URL field in Notion and select the data to send.


Replace Button Label with the text you want to display on the button.

### Connect Buildship to your Notion Database

In your database's full-page view, click the three dots (...) in the top-right corner, select "Connect to", and add Buildship.

Click the newly added button on any database row to send test data.

</Steps>



## Input / Output Mapping and Get Data

Once the above steps are completed and the test data is sent, you can map the payload from the Notion Trigger to the inputs of your workflow.

You can use the `Get Data` button to fetch the latest data from your Notion Button.

This trigger does not have any output mapping as it is an integration-based trigger.
