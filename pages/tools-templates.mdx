# Community Tools and Templates

If you have a BuildShip workflow that you'd like to share with the community, you can do so by submitting it to the
[Community Tools](https://buildship.tools/) and [Templates](https://app.buildship.com/templates) page.

## Submitting a Template

A template can be a workflow, a folder of a [README](/readme) and a workflow, a folder of multiple workflows.

### Save Examples for your Workflow

Once you have a workflow ready, you need to save some examples of the workflow in action. This will help the community
understand the workflow better.

To do this, test the workflow and then click on the **Save Example** button in the top right corner of the workflow
editor. This will save the test inputs and outputs as an example. [Learn more](/testing-examples)

### Create a Creator Profile

Once you have a workflow ready, click on the workflow menu in the side bar and select **Publish to Community**.

If you don't have a creator profile, you'll be prompted to create one. Here you can add your Display Name, Profile
Photo, a Unique ID, a short bio and a links to your social media profiles.

### Submit a Template

Once you have a creator profile, you'd be taken to the template submission page. Here you can add a title, description,
tags, and a thumbnail for your template. The form auto-populates with the details from your workflow.

Feel free to modify or add more details to the template. Once you're happy with the details, click on **Submit** to
publish your template.

### Template Review Process

Once you submit a template, it will be reviewed by the BuildShip team. Once approved, it will be published on the
[Community Tools](https://buildship.tools/) and [Templates](https://app.buildship.com/templates) page.

</Steps>

## Submitting a Tool

A tool is a single workflow with a "Tool Trigger" added to it.

<Callout>
  Submitting a tool is very similar to submitting a template. The only difference between a tool and a template is that
  a tool needs to have a "Tool Trigger" added to it. This would let you trigger the workflow as a tool via multiple
  agents.

Once submitted, the tool will be reviewed by the BuildShip team. Once approved, it will be published on the
[Community Tools](https://buildship.tools/) page.

## Updating a Submission

If you need to update a submission, you can do so by going to the workflow menu option and click on **Update Changes**.

This will let you update the details of the submission. Once you're happy with the changes, click on **Submit** to
publish the changes.

After re-submission, the tool will be reviewed by the BuildShip team again.
