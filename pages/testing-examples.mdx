# Saving and Using examples

Saving and using examples in BuildShip's testing feature allows you to preserve specific test cases for future reference and reuse. This functionality is particularly useful for maintaining consistency in your testing process and quickly re-executing tests with the same inputs.

> This feature is available for both individual node testing and full workflow testing.
