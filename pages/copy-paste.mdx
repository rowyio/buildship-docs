In BuildShip, copy and pasting functionality let's duplicate your workflows and nodes easily wherever required.

## Duplicating Workflows

The easiest way to duplicate an existing workflow is via copy and pasting. Users can copy and paste workflows across
projects, or within the same project.

<Steps>
### Copy Workflow
- Open the **Workflow Menu** (▿) next to the workflow name, and select '**Copy**' to copy the entire workflow schema.
<Image src={workflowActions} alt='copy/paste node' width={1200} />

### Paste Workflow

- Click the ✚ icon to create a new workflow (or open an existing workflow you wish to overwrite).
- Access the Workflow Menu again (▿), and choose '**Paste**' to duplicate or replace an existing workflow with the
  copied schema.
