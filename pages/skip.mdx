The "**Skip Nodes**" feature is designed to allow users to bypass the execution of specific nodes within their workflows
during workflow testing and deployment.

## Why Use Skip Nodes?

When dealing with nodes like the **OpenAI Chat** node or others that **involve frequent API requests**, repetitive
testing can be **costly**. The Skip Node feature allows users to exclude the execution of specific nodes during both
workflow testing and deployment.

The Skip Node preserves the output of the node from the previous node testing and re-uses it for all subsequent
executions.

## How Skip Node Works

<Steps>
### Skip Node Operation

- To skip the execution of a particular node, access the node menu.

- Click on the **Skip Node** option to enable the feature. If you have initially performed the node testing (via the
  Play Button (â–¹) on the node), the node will be marked with a **Skip** icon.

### Testing Data Input

- **If the node hasn't been tested before** and you wish to skip it, clicking the "**Skip Node**" button will prompt the
  node testing menu.

- **Input your testing data** within this menu and run the test. The output generated from this testing will be stored
  for future workflow execution.

After successful testing, the node can be skipped, utilizing the stored output for subsequent workflow runs.

### Unskipping a Node

If you wish to reintroduce the skipped nodes into live workflow execution, access the node menu again and click on
"**Unskip**".

</Steps>

Using the Skip Nodes feature ensures smoother development cycles by allowing selective node execution control,
optimizing workflows during testing, and preserving tested node outputs for subsequent runs.
