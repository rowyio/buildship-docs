# Path Variables in REST API Triggers

In BuildShip, you can define dynamic parts of the path using named parameters, often called wildcards or path variables.
This allows you to create flexible and reusable API endpoints.

## Setting Up Path Variables

To set up a path variable in the REST API trigger configuration, specify the Path and Method. For dynamic paths, use a
named parameter by prefixing it with a colon (`:`).

### Example Configuration

- **Path**: `/api/call/:id`
- **Method**: `GET` (or `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` depending on your requirement)

With this configuration, if a request is made to a URL like `https://myproject.buildship.run/api/call/123`, the workflow
associated with this path will be triggered. The variable part, `123`, is captured by `:id`.

## Accessing Path Variables

You can access the path variable within your workflow using the `request.path` object. The request will be the variable
from the Trigger. To extract the `id` from the path, you can use the following expression within your workflow's
expression editor:
