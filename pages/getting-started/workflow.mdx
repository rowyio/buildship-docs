A workflow is aÂ **visual representation** of a series of tasksÂ organized in a logical order to achieve a specific goal. 
Each task is shown as a node, and workflows are designed to automate processes, streamline activities, and respond 
effectively to different events.

**Key characteristics of workflows include:**

- **Trigger:** Every workflow is initiated with a trigger. Your workflow can be connected to one or more triggers.
- **Inputs:** Data points utilized in your workflow, connected to the incoming data from your trigger.
- **Nodes:** Individual components representing specific tasks or actions within the workflow.
- **Flow Output:**  The result generated by your workflow (optional). It can be a response to an API call or a return value to a trigger.

## How to build a Workflow?

Here's a comprehensive guide to building a workflow using BuildShip:

<Steps>
### Create a new workflow

_Begin by initiating a new workflow on the BuildShip dashboard._

You can click the + icon on the navigation panel on the left to create a new flow.

  You can start from scratch or select a suitable template closest to the idea you are building.

### Add workflow input

_Data points that you want to use in your workflow._

You can either add inputs to your workflow manually.

Or you can connect a trigger first and listen for incoming from the trigger 
and automatically pick the fields and map your input fields. 
In which case directly head over [Connect Triggers](#connect-triggers) section.

### Add logic nodes

_Logic nodes perform tasks and actions within your workflow._

Explore the Nodeverse, which offers a variety of pre-built nodes for data processing, communication, database, AI models and more. Select
nodes that align with the tasks you want to accomplish.

You could also create your own custom nodes using the "**Generate with AI**" feature from **the Nodeverse**.

Once a node is added, configure the node fields with the required values.
We have handy tool tips and info panel to explain what each field means and example values.

You can also customize the logic of every node with low-code capabilities using AI and direct code access. 
Offering you the ultimate flexibility and extensibility to build your logic.

### Add workflow output

_Optionally, include an output node at the end of your workflow._

The return statement provides output values that are returned as a response to the workflow being triggered.

### Test your workflow

_You can test individual nodes or the entire workflow to ensure it works without issues_

To test an individual workflow, click on the "Play" button on the node and enter sample values for the fields and click test.

To test the entire workflow you can switch the test panel to use "Flow" from the dropdown and enter test values for your input fields of the workflow.

You can save recent test runs of your workflow as an example so that you have them handy for retesting.

### Connect Triggers

_Triggers kick start your workflows to run based on specific events._

Click on the "**Connect**" mode on your workflow canvas, and select from the list of existing triggers,
such as API Requests,Scheduled Cron, Email, and more.

Follow the guided steps on the screen to connect the trigger and ensure the incoming data from your trigger is mapped to the input fields as needed.

You can also add multiple triggers to your workflow. For example: You can have an API, Email and Scheduled triggers.

### Ship the workflow

Finally, Ship your workflow to make it ready for production.
In case, you added a API trigger you will get an API url that 
you can use for integration in your frontend. After shipping, head to the "Usage" 
tab under the trigger to see how you can integrate this workflow to your 
app or services.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You've successfully created a dynamic workflow tailored to your needs. ðŸš€
