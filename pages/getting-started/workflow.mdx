A workflow is a **visual representation of a logical sequence of tasks** designed to achieve a specific goal. Each task
is represented by a node, and workflows are constructed to automate processes, streamline tasks, and efficiently respond
to various events.

**Key characteristics of workflows include:**

- **Trigger Nodes:** The first node is a trigger that initiates the workflow
- **Nodes:** Each node represents a specific task or action within the workflow
- **Return Nodes:** The last node can be a return statement, providing optional final outputs

## How to build a Workflow?

Here's a comprehensive guide to building a workflow using BuildShip:

<Steps>
### Create a new workflow

_Begin by initiating a new workflow on the BuildShip dashboard._

Navigate to the BuildShip dashboard and click on the "**New Workflow**" button.

### Adding Triggers

_Triggers initiate workflows based on specific events._

Click on the "**Add a Trigger**" button within your newly created workflow. Select from the list of existing triggers,
such as [HTTP Requests](/rest-api), [Scheduled Intervals](/scheduled-interval), or [Cron Jobs](/scheduled-cron).

### Adding Logic Nodes

_Logic nodes perform tasks and actions within your workflow._

Explore the Nodeverse, which offers a variety of pre-built nodes for data processing, communication, and more. Select
nodes that align with the tasks you want to accomplish.

You could also create your own custom nodes using the "**Generate with AI**" feature from **the Nodeverse**.

### Configuring the Nodes

With BuildShip's low-code capabilities, configuring each node is a user-friendly process that empowers you to tailor
your workflow to your exact requirements. Here's how you can do it:

- Click on the **Script Icon** on the node to open the **Node Editor**.
- Personalize the node's behavior according to your specific needs by manipulating the Node Logic, Input Params, Output,
  as well as the Node Description.

### Returning data from the Workflow

_Optionally, include a return statement at the end of your workflow._

The return statement provides output values that can be used for further processing or as a response.

Congratulations! You've successfully created a dynamic workflow tailored to your needs. ðŸš€
