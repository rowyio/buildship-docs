Within BuildShip, each node is designated to fulfill a specific function, and the combination of nodes forms a complete
workflow. Each workflow now has two default nodes: **Inputs** and **Outputs**.

> It's important to note that the initial node in any workflow must be a trigger node (find more information on triggers
> [here](/basics/trigger)). However, having a trigger is optional for testing workflows.

The fundamental building blocks of a workflow are the logic nodes. Let's delve into the details of a logic node's
structure and functionality of the **Inputs** and **Outputs** nodes.

## Node Anatomy

Explore the essential components and functionalities of Input and Output nodes, the building blocks of any workflow.

### Input Node

<Image src={inputNode} alt='Input Node' width={1200} />

The Input Node is designed to provide various types of inputs for your workflow. Here's a breakdown of its capabilities:

- **Input Types**: Easily add inputs of different types, including: **String**, **Number**, **Boolean**, **Array**,
  **Object**, **Select**, **Multi Select**, **Files**, **Any**.

- **Trigger Data**: Easily pass data from a Trigger node as input to use it across your workflow.

- **Edit Inputs**: An intuitive form based UI to edit inputs with the ability to set default values, descriptions, and,
  type, label, required field, sensitive field, and validation regex.

The input node ensures that your nodes receive the necessary data with the required type to perform their tasks
efficiently in the workflow.

### Output Node

The Output Node is designed to return the data from the workflow. Here's a breakdown of its capabilities:

  The output node is a **Return** node with advanced options
</Callout>

- **Output Types**: Choose between Last Node Output, or Custom Output.
- **Last Node Output**: Returns the output of the last node in the workflow.
- **Custom Output**: Return any custom value of your choice.

The output node ensures that your workflow returns the required data according to your workflow logic.

### Edit and Customize Nodes

- **Add Key**: Add the key for the node to use as authentication token or API key. Your keys are securely stored using
  BuildShip's Secret Manager.
- **Open Node Editor** `</>` This feature grants you the power to **modify the logic**, **input parameters**, **output
  configuration**, and **metadata descriptions** associated with a given node, providing the flexibility to tailor the
  nodes to your exact requirements.
- **Node Options** Manage nodes through **AI-powered editing**, **deletion**, **copying**, **skip node**, **save to team
  library**, and **add On Fail** options.
- **Value Expression Editor** Tap into the capabilities of **AI data autofill for inputs**, leverage **variables**, and
  safeguard sensitive information using **secret keys**.
- **Advanced Settings**: Configure additional advanced settings for the node. You can move any field under the advanced
  section by editing the node Inputs from the node editor and add a new section by clicking on the `folder` button.
- **Expand/Collapse Toggle** Enhance your workspace by toggling between expanded and collapsed views for nodes, ensuring
  a **clutter-free experience**.

## Node Editor `</>`

<Image src={v2NodeLogic} alt='Node Logic' width='1200' />

Node Logic is a versatile code editor within BuildShip that empowers users to create and customize the functionality of
a node. With Node Logic, you can:

- Write and modify the underlying functions for a node to suit your specific needs.
- Seamlessly integrate with APIs, leverage AI models, or incorporate NPM libraries to enhance your workflow's
  capabilities.
- Write Unit Tests for your node to ensure its functionality is working as expected.
- Whether selecting a node from the **Nodeverse library** or **generating one via AI**, the Node Editor provides a
  user-friendly environment for configuring nodes.

```js filename="Generate QR Codes"
import { toDataURL } from 'qrcode';

export default async function generateQRCode({ url }) {
  const qrCodeDataURL = await toDataURL(url);
  return qrCodeDataURL;
}
```

<Callout emoji='ðŸ’¡' type='tip'>
  If you wish to create your own node from scratch, you can do so by using the [Script node](../core-nodes/script).
</Callout>
Moreover, the Node Editor is accompanied by a **testing environment**, enabling users to **edit and test nodes simultaneously**,
all without the need for deployment.

## Input Params

Input parameters for a node are variables or values that can be provided as input to the node when it is executed. These
parameters serve as the data that the node needs to perform its specific task.

These parameters can be set in the form UI or via JSON schema.

  page](./input).

## Output

The Node Editor empowers you to modify your node's output configurations. The structured JSON format ensures clarity in
handling resulting data, promoting seamless integration with downstream processes.

## Node Info

Just as input parameters are accompanied by comprehensive descriptions, the "Info" section contains essential insights
about the node's purpose and functionality. This contextual information aids in better understanding the node's role
within your workflow. In the Node Info, you can:

- Add Name, Description, and Icon for the node.
- Select the NPM Package to execute for the SDK.
- Select the required integration.
