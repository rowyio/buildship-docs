# Node Output

import Image from 'next/image';
import output1 from '/public/basics/output1.png';

Output configuration for a node involves specifying how the node will produce and format its output data. It defines the
structure and content of the data that the node will generate as a result of its execution.

The output configuration is defined in the `output` section of the node configuration file. These parameters **can be
set in the form UI or via JSON schema**.

## Structure of the Output Configuration

The structure is a JSON object that defines the output configuration for a node.

Let's understand the structure using an example, here's a sample output configuration for a node:

```json
{
  "buildship": {},
  "description": "The response from the Cohere detectLanguage API",
  "type": "object",
  "title": "Cohere Response",
  "properties": {}
}
```

- `description`: This field provides a brief description of the output. In this case, it describes the output as "The
  response from the Cohere detectLanguage API."

- `type`: Specifies the overarching data type of the output, which is "object." This indicates that the output data will
  be structured as a JSON object.

- `title`: This is a user-friendly title or label for the output, which is "Cohere Response" in this example.

- `properties`: This field is typically used to define the individual components or variables within the output data.
  However, in this example, it's empty, which means that there are no specific properties defined for the output.
