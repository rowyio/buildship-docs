# Email Trigger

The **Email Trigger** is a powerful feature that **allows you to initiate a BuildShip workflow every time an email is
sent to the email address provided by the trigger**. This trigger provides a convenient and automated way to integrate
email communication into your workflows, enabling a wide range of use cases and automations.

## How It Works

### Email Address

When you set up the Email Trigger, BuildShip generates a unique, custom email address for your workflow. This email
address follows the format `workflowId@buildship.email`. For example, if your workflow ID is `E0J4S2eQy5ND8fTXCCns`, the
corresponding email address would be `E0J4S2eQy5ND8fTXCCns@buildship.email`.

Whenever an email is sent to this custom email address, the Email Trigger is activated, and the workflow is initiated.

### Email Content Access

The entire email content, including the **subject**, **body**, **attachments**, and **metadata**, is made available to
the workflow as the request body. You can access and process this information using the appropriate nodes within your
workflow. [Learn more](#accessing-email-data).

## Using the Email Trigger

To use the Email Trigger, follow these steps:

1. Create a new workflow in your BuildShip Project, or open an existing workflow that you want to add the Email Trigger
   to.
2. Click on "**Add Trigger**" button. In the Trigger Library, select the "**Email Trigger**".
   <Callout>
     In case of modifying an existing workflow, delete the existing trigger and then click on "**Add Trigger**" button.
     In the Trigger Library, select the "**Email Trigger**".
   </Callout>
3. You'll be able to **access the incoming Email data** in the following nodes via the **context menu**.
4. Save the workflow and note the custom email address generated for the Email Trigger.

Once the Email Trigger is set up, you can initiate the associated workflow by simply sending an email to the provided
custom email address. The workflow will automatically start executing, and you can process the email content using the
appropriate nodes within your workflow.

You can access this information in the following nodes. For example, you can extract the email body, or perform any
desired actions based on the received email content.
