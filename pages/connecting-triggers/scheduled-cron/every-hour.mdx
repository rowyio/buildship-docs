# Every Hour Trigger

The **Every Hour (Cron)** trigger is a convenient way to **schedule a workflow to run automatically every hour**. This
trigger allows you to set up a recurring hourly execution for your workflows, similar to a traditional cron job. It can
be particularly useful for automating tasks or processes that need to be executed on an hourly basis.

## Trigger Inputs

### Time Zone

This is the only input field for this trigger. Here, you can **choose the appropriate time zone** for your scheduled
trigger. The available time zones are listed, including popular options like `UTC`, `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`,
`Asia/Shanghai`, and others.

## Trigger Outputs

This trigger does not have any specific outputs since its purpose is to initiate the execution of a workflow every hour.
The outputs will depend on the workflow itself and the actions it performs.

## Possible Use Cases

The **Every Hour (Cron)** trigger can be useful in various scenarios where you need to automate recurring hourly tasks
or processes. Here are some potential use cases:

- **Data Synchronization:** Schedule a workflow to synchronize data between different systems or databases on an hourly
  basis.

  updates.
- **Web Scraping:** Scrape data from websites or APIs on an hourly basis for real-time data collection or analysis.
