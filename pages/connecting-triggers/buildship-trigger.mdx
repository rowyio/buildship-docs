The BuildShip Trigger serves as a **mechanism to initiate a BuildShip Workflow from another workflow** by employing the
**Execute Workflow** node.

This functionality enables users to trigger workflows within the same project or across different projects.

<Callout type='tip'>
  TIP ðŸ’¡: An alternative method to accomplish this is through the **API Call** Node available in the Node Library.

## Understanding the Mechanism

**1. Execute Workflow Node**

This node is added to the primary workflow and serves the purpose of initiating the secondary workflow.

**2. BuildShip Trigger**

This is integrated into the secondary workflow, which is intended to be triggered.

## Execute Workflow Node

The Execute Workflow Node empowers users to trigger any workflow, regardless of whether it belongs to the same or a
different project.

For the Execute Workflow Node, the following information is required:

### Project ID (optional)

When executing a BuildShip Workflow that isn't part of the current project, users **must specify the Project ID**.

This ID can be found within the **BuildShip Trigger Config** or in the **BuildShip Project Settings** page.

### Workflow ID

The Workflow ID is necessary to identify the workflow to be invoked. Users can retrieve this ID from the BuildShip
Trigger config or copy it from the address bar. The Workflow ID is the last part of the URL, as shown below:

```
https://buildship.app/p/project-id/workflow/workflow-id
```

### Data

This input allows users to pass data to another workflow as the request body. The data format is expected to be in the
form of a JSON object.

**Sample Data Object:**

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

### Await?

This boolean input determines whether the triggered secondary workflow needs to complete before proceeding with the
remaining nodes in the primary workflow.

## The BuildShip Trigger

To complete this mechanism, users need to include the BuildShip Trigger Node in the secondary workflow intended to be
initiated via the Execute Workflow node.

The BuildShip Trigger node processes incoming trigger requests from the "**Execute Workflow**" node, validating the
source and authenticating it.

If calling the target workflow from a different BuildShip Project (other than the one housing the target workflow),
users need to specify the Runtime Service Account from the other project. This information can be obtained from the
Project Settings page within BuildShip.

If the user needs to call the target workflow from a different BuildShip Project (other than the one with the target
workflow), users need to specify the Runtime Service Account of other project (one with the "**Execute Workflow**"
Node). The BuildShip Runtime Service Account can be obtained from the Project Settings page.

The data passed through the Execute Workflow node can be accessed in the target workflow using the Data variable from
the context menu in the Input Editor.
