# GitHub Trigger

The GitHub Trigger is a powerful tool that allows you to **create a webhook on a GitHub repository**, enabling you to
**execute a BuildShip workflow whenever specific events occur in the repository**. This integration seamlessly connects
your GitHub projects with BuildShip, unlocking a world of automation possibilities.

## Authentication

The GitHub Trigger leverages **OAuth** for authentication, providing a secure and user-friendly experience. Users are
prompted to grant the necessary permissions to BuildShip during the configuration process, eliminating the need to share
sensitive API keys.

To authenticate, users simply click on the **fingerprint icon**, which redirects them to the GitHub login page. After
granting the necessary permissions, the red fingerprint icon will turn green, indicating successful authentication.

### Repository

The **GitHub Repository for which you want to set up the webhook**. Ensure that you have the required permissions to
create a webhook for the selected repository.

### Owner

The **owner (user or organization)** of the repository for which you want to set up the webhook.

### Events

The **list of events that will trigger the associated BuildShip workflow**. You can choose from a wide range of **over
40 events**, including:

- `push`: Triggered when code is pushed to the repository.
- `issues`: Triggered when issues are opened, closed, or updated.
- `pull_request`: Triggered when pull requests are opened, closed, or updated.
- `release`: Triggered when a new release is published.
- `fork`: Triggered when the repository is forked.
- And many more!

For a comprehensive list of available events, their descriptions, and the expected payload, refer to the
[GitHub Webhook Events and Payloads documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads).

## Use Cases

The GitHub Trigger opens up a world of possibilities for automating various tasks and processes related to your GitHub
projects. Here are some interesting use cases:

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):** Trigger a BuildShip workflow to build, test, and deploy your
  application whenever code is pushed to a specific branch or when a pull request is merged.

- **Issue and Pull Request Management:** Automate tasks like assigning labels, adding comments, or moving issues to a
  project board based on specific events related to issues and pull requests.

- **Release Management:** Trigger a workflow to create and publish release notes, update documentation, or notify
  relevant stakeholders when a new release is published.

- **Repository Monitoring:** Set up workflows to monitor repository activity, such as forks, stars, or branch protection
  changes, and take appropriate actions based on the events.

- **Collaboration and Notifications:** Integrate with various communication channels (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) to
  receive notifications or updates about repository events, facilitating better collaboration among team members.
