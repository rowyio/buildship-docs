# Execute BuildShip Workflow

The Execute BuildShip Workflow Node allows you to execute a BuildShip workflow from another workflow within your current
workspace.

This node is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to automate tasks by executing predefined workflows. It
can be used in conjunction with any trigger to initiate workflows internally and at any step of your workflow.

## Node Configuration

The Execute BuildShip Workflow Node has the following configuration options:

### Flow

Select the workflow you want to execute. This is the target workflow that will be triggered from your main workflow.

### Node Inputs

Provide the inputs required by the selected workflow. These inputs will be passed to the workflow when it is executed.

<Callout emoji='ðŸ’¡' type='tip'>
  Ensure that the inputs match the expected format and data types required by the target workflow.
</Callout>

## Example

For example, if you have a workflow that processes incoming requests, you can use the Execute BuildShip Workflow Node to
trigger this workflow with specific input data from any other workflow from your workspace.

<Image src={execute3} alt='Execute BuildShip Workflow Example' width={1200} />

This node will automatically add a Execute BuildShip trigger to the workflow being called, you can use any trigger on
the child workflow (the workflow being called ), after connecting it from the Execute BuildShip Workflow Node, it will
automatically ship the workflow.
